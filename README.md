- **Locations** - This taxonomy is associated with Branches/Head Offices Archive.
- **Departments** - This taxonomy is associated with Commanding/Principal Officers Archive and Profiles Archive.

### Shortcodes

The plugin comes with two (2) shortcodes: Newsletter Form and Contact Form shortcode. These shortcodes requires [Highway Traffic Safety Agency](<https://codestar.com.ng/shop/highway-traffic-security-agency>) Wordpress theme in order for it to be displayed on the site.

Your credentials will be used to process email delivery when a user makes a contact request via the contact form, or when a user subscribes to newsletters via the newsletter subscription form.

### Custom URL Endpoints

The plugin comes with three (3) custom url endpoints. For custom url endpoint to work, you must ensure that in your **Permalink Settings**, **Common Settings** MUST be set to **Post name**.

- `/email-confirmation` - This endpoint is where subscribers are redirected to after clicking the email verification link sent to their email inbox
- `/email-subscription` - This endpoint is where subscribers are redirected to after clicking the unsubscribe link in their email notifications
- `/htsa-shortcodes` - This endpoint is only accessible by an admin, and only displays demo examples of shortcodes that comes with the plugin
